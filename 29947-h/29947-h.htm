<h1>SPACEMEN NEVER DIE!</h1>

<h2><i>By Morris Hershman</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Henry Weller</span> stood facing
a huge three-dimensional
picture on the wall of his
dining room.</p>

<p>"Can't we get rid of it?" he
asked, turning to his wife. "I
mean, with all due respect, of
course."</p>

<p>No man enjoys coming into his
dining room and having to sit at
meals and look at a full-sized picture
of his wife's first husband arriving
on Venus. Fair's fair, but
such a set-up is ridiculous.</p>

<p>"No," Phoebe shook her blonde
head. "Don Manton loved me
and he was famous. I like to be
reminded of the days when my
picture was in all the telepapers
and my face on so many telescreens."</p>

<p>She might just as well have called
him a tattered nonentity, though
Henry was doing pretty well as a
foreman in the local humandroid
factory. He was stopped from reminding
her by Phoebe's saying
that she'd leave for a bit of shopping.
She left abruptly.</p>

<p>Henry watched her takeoff from
the roof of their two-story fibroid
house and went back to the dining
room. Now, even his warmest admirers
would give in that he had
a streak of stubbornness in him a
mile wide and six miles deep.
Henry took the three-dimensional
monstrosity off the wall, holding
it hard by thumb and forefinger
on its luminex frame, and prepared
to say good-by to the picture
of Don Manton.</p>

<p>A foreman at one of the humandroid
shops has to be able to consider
alternatives and Henry had
done this. If he only hid the picture
there'd be a domestic crisis
and the picture would sooner or
later be back on the wall; if he
destroyed it there'd also be a crisis,
but one that would eventually
blow over.</p>

<p>Unluckily for him, these three-dimensional
wall pictures were made
out of glaseine, and when he tried
setting fire to it he nearly burned
down the house. Upon feeding it to
the old-fashioned fireplace nothing
grew hot except his temper. Ripping
the picture to shreds would
have been the next step, but you
can't rip glaseine.</p>

<p>For maybe the six millionth time
he cursed out Don Manton, the
well-known explorer in the realm
of outer space. Henry understood
in a general way that Don Manton
had been among the first to chart
the cities of Mars and Venus, and
had accidentally died on a planet
named Immel; but Henry had no
intention of living in Don Manton's
shadow.</p>

<p>The picture, which showed the
late explorer talking with three
Venusians, had been hung up again
when Phoebe came through the
ceiling door along the extension
stairway which flicked up to meet
her.</p>

<p>"You've been trying to get rid
of Don's picture!"</p>

<p>He'd hung it crookedly, and a
diagonal slash of white wallpaper
had given him away.</p>

<p>"Just this one. You've got cans
of telefilm in the cellar, but them
I don't mind. This," he flicked it
with a thumbnail, "I do mind."</p>

<p>"As long as I stay," Phoebe said
quietly, "my darling Don's picture
stays."</p>

<p>"But what about your darling
Henry? Am I just a humandroid
who looks and behaves and talks
like a human being? Haven't I
got feelings?" Henry strode around
the room, hitting the fibroid floor
like a prehistoric monster on a
sandpaper bridge. "Either that
picture goes," he said finally, definitely,
"or I go!"</p>

<p>Phoebe shook out her blonde
hair, letting it fall about her
shoulders. "Too bad."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Inside</span> of an hour he had packed
his suitcases. Phoebe cried
bitterly, but wouldn't budge about
the picture. Henry took the plane.
He put up at his club, went to the
bar, and was gobbling down something
called pressurized scotch,
when he heard a noise back of him.</p>

<p>"Get away from me!" said Henry,
who was quite a few over the
traditional eight by this time.
"I've had enough of Don Manton,
let alone his helpers."</p>

<p>Speed Roggs, who had taken a
couple of trips with Manton, was
tall and thin as the barstool, and
with a spaceman's ability to think
fast when he had to. Loudly he ordered
a Venuswiz, explaining to a
disgusted Henry, "After the barkeep
mixes the drink he melts the
swizzle stick and pours that in,
too." He gulped the stuff down
gratefully, then said, "Tell me
your troubles, Hank."</p>

<p>Henry did. Speed Roggs looked
disgusted. "Are you serious?"
he asked, and when Henry swore
to cut Speed's throat on asking
that again, went on, "Women are
space-mad!"</p>

<p>As Henry agreed, Roggs said,
"The one thing you don't understand
about Don Manton is that
he was maladjusted. He couldn't
stay still, he always wanted what
he couldn't have. That goes for
his feelings for women, too."</p>

<p>Henry looked up with bloodshot
eyes nearly popping out of his
head.</p>

<p>Roggs kept going. "Don and
Phoebe never got along once they
were married. It was Manton's
fault. Like all explorers he was
unhappy over his lot and looked
beyond the rainbow. In fact, he
told me once that the only reason
he went in for exploring space
was to get away from his wife."</p>

<p>Henry Weller suddenly rocked
with laughter. He got to his feet,
took Roggs, and went to his
room, still laughing. He lay on
the bed for half an hour. At the
end of that time he sat up.</p>

<p>"Tell the manager I won't be
here for supper," he said to Speed.
"I've got a little trip to make."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Home, to give the good tidings
to my wife."</p>

<p>Henry's fibroid house looked
about the same. He parked the
plane and let himself in by the
roof door and down the extension
staircase. He found Phoebe in the
kitchen bent over a pot, and at
sound of him she turned. A near-smile
flickered in her blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Phoebe ..."</p>

<p>"Henry ..."</p>

<p>They laughed together. Henry
wanted to tell her what he knew
as bitterly and maliciously as possible,
but he simply opened his
mouth a few times. He couldn't
say it. Everyone is entitled to an
illusion and this was Phoebe, his
blonde wench, his wife, his woman.
He looked a bit sick.</p>

<p>She smiled. "Come into the dining room."</p>

<p>The three-dimensional picture
had been rolled up into the corner.
Henry promised to put it away in
the cellar and clean up the cellar
as soon as he could. Phoebe said
that her first husband had never
liked to stay home, he'd always
been afraid to live normally.</p>

<p>"I was wrong about the picture,"
she told him, "and I didn't
know till I saw you leave the
house."</p>

<p>It goes without saying that Henry
and his Phoebe lived happily
ever after, but it is perhaps not
so well known that Phoebe was
left with a little disposal problem,
too. She had a rough time finding
a buyer (in secret, of course)
for her brand-new humandroid, who
looked and behaved and talked so
exactly like that well-known flyer,
Speed Roggs....</p>
